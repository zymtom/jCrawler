# jCrawler
This is a very basic yet versatile class. It currently support a few prebuilt regex patterns for proxies, telephonenumber and emails, and in the future it will have a support for custom regex patterns.

It was written as a schoolproject, is not very polished and does not contain very good coding standards, but it's a testament to my journey as a developer.
